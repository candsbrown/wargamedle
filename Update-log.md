## Updates
# 11/24/2024:
updated script.js,
finalizing index.html,
new unitData file with all units (except italy).

Almost functional game!
Problems with unit selection (units from different nations with identical names will always be registered as one particular unit)
Problems with data: frontal armor values for inf and air units are 0.6 and 0.8??? thx eugene

# 11/23/2024:
Test commit: new site look, refactored code.

# 11/18/2024:
WE HAVE ASSUMED CONTROL.

# 9-27-2024:

*Added guess summary. Now, all correct information is stored at the top of the page.

*Added values to guesses. Instead of  "price is too low" the actual price will be listed alongside the too high or low indication.

*Re-ordered page for the time being. Still bad, but important information should be always available, and the guess history should have the most recent guess at the top of the list, not the bottom.

*Fixed ATGM Milan teams having an armor value of 1 instead of 0.

*Dimmed the page to a gray for now, and changed color of some text. I'll do another pass at it eventually, but the goal is function still.
# 9-27-2024:

*Finished adding US Tank tab.
# 9-26-2024:

*Added UK Recon tab to game.
# 9-24-2024:

*Added FAV tag to game. Accuracy should be next, though need to figure out where it will go on some units.

*Added FAV tag to all units.

*Added UK Support tab to better test nation tag.

*Fixed AH-64D Longbow incorrectly being tagged as helo instead of recon
# 9-21-2024:

*Added nation tag functionality to game. Stealth, accuracy and FAV may all be good additional tags, though accuracy will not always be 1st weapon.

*Added nation tags to all existing units. Not very useful since predominately US (they're the first in the armory tab). Next drop will be support tab for another country to test new tag.
# 9-20-2024:

*Reset button has been fixed
# 9-19-2024 (2): 

*Added auto-complete functionality to the search bar. Should significantly speed up guess submission and prevent typos, though a second pass may be needed for optimization with a large unit list.

*Added US Infantry Tab.

*Cleaned up the JS script a little. Still rough, but slightly better.
# 9-19-2024: 

*Added US Logistics Tab, removed FOB. 

*Added functionality to support guess history, and attached previous hints to them. 

*Attempt counter has been temporarily disabled.

*CSS has been updated to be less terrible.

*Some clutter has been removed from the JS, but needs a second pass at some point.
