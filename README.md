# Wargamedle
Wordle-like game featuring the Wargame: Red Dragon Units!

Guess a unit to get clues about the attributes of the mystery unit!

Version 1.0

Big thanks to Redcheetah, check out his original prototype here: https://redcheetah0117.github.io/Mechdle/

## Disclaimers: 
- Naval tab units ARE enabled! (this might not be the case for long)
- Command units and recon units still have the icon codes in their names (e.g. #reco3, #command)
- it's probably buggy!
